## Workspace Crates

- `crates/ag-clipboard/`: Read-only clipboard support crate with the narrow text,
  file-list, and RGBA image read surface used by prompt image capture. Platform backends
  own macOS pasteboard access, X11 selection reads, Wayland `wl-paste` reads, and
  unsupported-backend reporting.
- `crates/ag-contracts/`: Transport-independent session and one-shot execution
  contracts, continuation state, settings, usage, events, and errors. It has no
  dependency on provider implementations, persistence, or a frontend.
- `crates/ag-runtime/`: Worker-consumed runtime composition, harness dispatch, and
  provider lifecycle. It is the sole consumer of `ag-agent`.
- `crates/ag-worker/`: Session mailboxes and execution clients, bounded utility runs,
  cancellation, heartbeats, completion, and restart recovery. Hosts supply queue policy
  and ordered workflow effects; storage implements worker-owned operation contracts.
- `crates/ag-agent/`: External-agent adapters, prompt templates, provider discovery, and
  CLI/app-server transport ownership. It implements `ag-contracts` interfaces and owns
  cancellation of provider resources.
- `crates/ag-forge/`: Shared forge review-request library crate with normalized
  review-request and comment-thread types, GitHub/GitLab remote detection, thread
  reply/resolution, and the `gh`/`glab` adapters behind the `ReviewRequestClient` and
  `ForgeCommandRunner` boundaries.
- `crates/ag-git/`: Shared git library crate with worktree creation, repository
  metadata, commit/diff/push/pull sync, merge-conflict preflights, rebase/conflict
  handling, and squash-merge workflows behind the `GitClient` boundary.
- `crates/ag-harness/`: Provider-neutral structured model turns with a shared engine for
  durable sessions and one-shot calls. Immutable `TurnOptions` define output schemas,
  permissions, budgets, and optional comparison bases. Ordered `TurnInput` carries
  bounded text and image blocks for both entry points, validated before acquisition and
  translated only for provider configurations with declared image support. Owned
  sessions and builders capture harness configuration and share lazy SQLite
  initialization. The library owns a host model registry used by harness construction;
  registrations carry capability declarations and the recovery contract's execution
  identity, and a declared context budget bounds request projection to recent whole
  turns through an injectable estimator. It also owns history, leases, terminal
  transitions, and write journals through a public transactional `SessionStore` with
  SQLite and process-local `MemoryStore` backends. The store also owns atomic
  host-request deduplication and complete result recovery. Hosts can inject stores;
  shared local admission retains acquisition and cleanup ownership. Controlled turn
  futures expose turn-scoped cancellation with independent persistence and managed
  filesystem-effect settlement after caller drop. Retained write workers own replacement
  completion and journal recording; local admission remains protected until both settle,
  with unacknowledged completion blocking admission for the process lifetime. Its
  `SqliteStore` implementation encapsulates pool access and row decoding. Bounded tools
  use validated `Repository` and injectable `FileSystem` boundaries. Hosts own prompts,
  comparison-base selection, permissions, and telemetry setup; the engine enforces a
  validated, pinned commit for comparisons. Private execution contracts and
  platform-independent supervision own bounded preparation, output draining, and
  retained cleanup for sandboxed Bash. A trusted launcher implements Linux namespace
  isolation and macOS Seatbelt with explicitly best-effort process-group cleanup.
  Command journals and settlement remain separate from patch-write effects.
- `crates/ag-harness-cli/`: Interactive `ag-harness` command-line application and its
  process-level tests. It derives provider parsing and help from `ag-harness`, then owns
  command-line defaults, application prompts, bounded repository permission selection,
  terminal-safe output, and creation and resumption of durable sessions.
- `crates/ag-orchestration/`: Frontend-neutral campaign planning, approval,
  reconciliation, verification, integration, and controller/child prompt templates.
  Hosts inject `SessionService`, persistence repositories, `OrchestrationEventSink`, and
  `OrchestrationSchedule`; the crate does not depend on `agentty` or terminal UI.
- `crates/ag-protocol/`: Shared structured response protocol library crate with
  transport-neutral response models, schema generation, parser diagnostics, protocol
  prompt envelopes, repair prompts, review-comment outcomes, and turn prompt payload
  helpers.
- `crates/ag-session/`: Frontend-neutral session library with stable identity,
  lifecycle, built-in agent/model catalog, orchestration, project, personality,
  review-link, setting, clarification, and transcript models; complete session
  aggregates; pure policy and parsing helpers; and the object-safe `SessionBackend` port
  exposed through the owned, cloneable `SessionService` for creation, lookup, messaging,
  structured question answers, durable coordinator submissions, cancellation, merge, and
  review-request workflows.
- `crates/ag-store/`: Reusable persistence library with narrow repository contracts,
  SQLite adapters, WAL/foreign-key connection setup, offline SQLx query metadata, and
  embedded migrations. Host applications may inject a `TimestampSource` while the
  default constructors use the system clock.
- `crates/ag-tui-text/`: Shared Ratatui text-rendering library crate with Markdown
  parsing/styling, forge HTML normalization, bounded mermaid-to-terminal diagram
  rendering, and terminal-width wrapping/truncation helpers. Host applications inject
  semantic palette and cache version settings at the render boundary.
- `crates/agentty/`: Main TUI application crate with composition root, application,
  domain, infrastructure, runtime, and UI layers.
- `crates/testty/`: Rust-native TUI end-to-end testing framework with PTY-driven
  semantic assertions and VHS visual capture. Also ships the language-agnostic `testty`
  command-line binary for non-Rust projects.
- `crates/ag-xtask/`: Workspace maintenance commands, including SQL migration numbering
  and instruction integrity checks.

## Application Layers (`crates/agentty/src/`)

- `main.rs` / `lib.rs`: Composition root — database bootstrap, `App` construction,
  runtime launch, and public module exports.
- `app/`: Orchestration layer. Owns the `App` state, the `AppEvent` reducer, project and
  settings persistence manager, the merge queue, the project sync orchestrator, campaign
  workflow wiring, managed-worker capability routing, the application adapter for
  `ag-orchestration` notifications, branch publish, review, generation-matched
  background full-diff requests, typed prompt workflow requests and outcomes, the
  `session_api.rs` adapter for `ag-session`, the bounded `session_runtime.rs` command
  actor, prepared background session creation with foreground completion, and the
  session module (`app/session/`) with its worker handles, queue policy, and workflow
  steps (`lifecycle`, `turn`, `post_turn`, `merge`, `task`, `worker`). Prompt composers,
  slash-menu state, and mode navigation remain presentation-owned. No direct process,
  filesystem, or clock calls — everything external goes through `infra/` traits.
- `domain/`: Pure Agentty-specific business entities and logic — render/runtime session
  snapshots, themes, clarification input progress, explicit transient-message slots and
  lifecycles, prompt-composer logic, the shared `InputState` command and undo/redo
  model, stable input-revision and character-offset identities used to bind prompt
  attachments to exact placeholder occurrences and history states, session
  action-eligibility and list-ordering policies, and fuzzy file-entry ranking shared by
  runtime selection and UI suggestions. Thin compatibility modules re-export
  `ag-session` provider metadata, agent/model selections and session models, and shared
  protocol turn prompt payloads, plus settings and execution types from `ag-contracts`.
  No I/O.
- `infra/`: External integrations behind traits — Agentty data-root resolution and
  `ag-store` composition, git (`GitClient`, backed by `ag-git`), filesystem
  (`FsClient`), the session-worktree-only personality catalog, tmux, clipboard images,
  version checks, project discovery, and file indexing. Clipboard image capture
  delegates host clipboard reads to `ag-clipboard`, then owns temp-file persistence and
  attachment metadata. Agentty accesses provider lifecycle through `ag-worker`; provider
  registry, router, parser, and transport internals stay private to `crates/ag-agent/`.
- `runtime/`: Terminal lifecycle and the event loop — terminal setup and mouse-capture
  toggling, the event-reader thread, key dispatch, mode-focused handlers under
  `runtime/mode/`, mouse dispatch in `runtime/mouse_handler.rs` with list and menu
  clicks resolved in `runtime/click_handler.rs`, and shared handlers for common
  interactions such as review-request detail navigation, session-output metrics,
  transcript scrolling, `KeyEvent` mapping to domain input commands, and session
  review-comment navigation, address/deny marking, and batch submission. Runtime owns
  `PresentationState`, including the shared `RenderCacheStore` used by input metrics and
  frame rendering, the `LayoutSnapshot` recorded by the last frame, and scrollbar drag
  state.
- `presentation.rs` and `presentation/`: Frontend-neutral interaction state shared by
  runtime input and UI output. They expose mode, help-action, prompt, settings-screen
  actions, editor, scroll, viewport, per-frame scroll-region layout and scrollbar
  geometry (`presentation/viewport.rs`), semantic list-selection contracts, and one
  coherent `FrameTime` value per render pass without importing Ratatui or `ui/`
  formatting. `presentation/review_comment.rs` owns review comment group ordering and
  headings while preserving forge-thread selection and batch actions across grouped
  snapshot refreshes. `presentation/setting.rs` owns settings row selection, selectors,
  launch-configuration editing through the shared `InputState`, and render-ready
  settings snapshots; it returns typed persistence operations to `app/setting.rs`.
- `ui/`: Rendering — frame composition, mode-to-page routing, pages under `ui/page/`,
  reusable widgets under `ui/component/`, application-to-frame projection in
  `ui/app_render.rs`, the per-frame scroll-region and clickable-list recorder in
  `ui/layout_snapshot.rs`, Agentty theme adapters for `ag-tui-text`, plus diff, layout,
  review-comment formatting, the unified Diff Files/Comments workspace, and theme
  helpers. `ui/session_output_assembly.rs` owns the pure transcript-to-display-line
  projection; the `SessionOutput` component retains layout caching, scrollbar metrics,
  loader effects, and Ratatui painting.

## Layer Rules

Session process accounting follows these boundaries: `infra` samples the host through
`ResourceClient` and validates native process identities, `app` owns sampling and cache
invalidation, `domain` defines resource totals, and `ui` formats the immutable snapshot
for session chat.

- Workflow and state transitions live in `app/`, not in UI rendering modules.
- `App` does not render terminal frames or own concrete render caches; runtime passes
  its presentation cache into the UI projection boundary.
- `App::view_snapshot()` creates the immutable borrowed application view consumed by
  frontends. `ui/app_render.rs` receives that snapshot plus runtime-owned Ratatui state
  and does not access the concrete `App`, services, or managers directly. The snapshot
  resolves the injected clock once into `FrameTime`, including Unix seconds,
  milliseconds, and the clock-provided UTC offset used by deterministic timers, loaders,
  and activity-day projections. Fixed clocks own both their timestamp and offset, so
  render projections do not depend on the host timezone.
- Session activity persistence stores timestamps supplied by the injected `Clock`.
  Session loading retrieves those immutable timestamps and applies the clock-provided
  offset for each event before aggregating local-day counts; SQLite does not read the
  host clock or timezone for this projection.
- Application managers retain semantic selected-row indexes through
  `domain::selection::SelectionState`; runtime owns Ratatui table viewport state and
  synchronizes selection at the frame projection boundary.
- `app/` must not import runtime mode handlers. Shared interaction calculations belong
  in `domain/` or `presentation.rs`, while application task registries belong in `app/`.
- Runtime converts presentation-owned prompt state into typed app requests, then applies
  returned navigation and composer effects. `app/` must not inspect or mutate `AppMode`.
- Frontend-neutral session entities, enums, and policies live in `ag-session`; keep only
  Agentty-specific entities and interaction state in `domain/`.
- SQLite repositories, offline query metadata, and migrations live in `ag-store`.
  Operation contracts belong to `ag-worker`; other persistence contracts stay in
  `ag-store`. Agentty's `infra/db.rs` owns application-specific database location and
  timestamp-source composition.
- External side effects live in `infra/` behind mockable traits; see
  [Testability Boundaries](@/docs/architecture/testability-boundaries.md).
- `module.rs` files paired with a `module/` directory stay router-only.
- Change-path guidance for common scenarios lives in
  [Change Recipes](@/docs/architecture/change-recipes.md).

## Worker-owned model execution

Application workflows use `ag-worker::SessionRunClient` for session turns and
`ag-worker::RunClient` for isolated model work. The worker owns runtime handles,
mailboxes, utility admission, concurrency, cancellation, and execution lifecycle;
`ag-runtime` constructs and dispatches adapters, and `ag-agent` implements harness
transports. `ag-contracts` owns shared execution data and interfaces. Only `ag-worker`
depends on `ag-runtime`; only `ag-runtime` depends on `ag-agent`. `ag-store` persists
utility runs independently of session-only workflow operations.

See [Execution](@/docs/core-components/execution.md) for the execution contract.
